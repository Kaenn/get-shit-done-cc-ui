## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v1.1 ordered phases: Sidebar (7) > Viewer (8) > Tree (9) > Commands (10)
- Viewer before Tree because tree-click-to-view depends on viewer
- Default sidebarActiveView to 'commands' for initial state (07-01)
- Use Terminal icon for Commands, FolderTree for State (07-01)
- Prevent toggle deselection to maintain active view (07-01)
- GSDIconSidebar MUST be first child in flex container for left edge positioning (07-02)
- Instant view switching without animation (07-02)
- Tab state is runtime-only (not persisted across app restarts) (08-01)
- Duplicate filepath detection prevents multiple tabs for same file (08-01)
- Closing active tab auto-selects adjacent tab (prefer right, fallback left) (08-01)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

### v1.1 Research Summary

From research/SUMMARY.md:
