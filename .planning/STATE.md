## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v1.1 ordered phases: Sidebar (7) > Viewer (8) > Tree (9) > Commands (10)
- Viewer before Tree because tree-click-to-view depends on viewer
- Default sidebarActiveView to 'commands' for initial state (07-01)
- Use Terminal icon for Commands, FolderTree for State (07-01)
- Prevent toggle deselection to maintain active view (07-01)
- GSDIconSidebar MUST be first child in flex container for left edge positioning (07-02)
- Instant view switching without animation (07-02)
- Tab state is runtime-only (not persisted across app restarts) (08-01)
- Duplicate filepath detection prevents multiple tabs for same file (08-01)
- Closing active tab auto-selects adjacent tab (prefer right, fallback left) (08-01)
- Code blocks use copy button appearing on hover for cleaner UI (08-03)
- Frontmatter defaults to collapsed state for content-focused view (08-03)
- Internal .md links call openFile action for in-app navigation (08-03)
- External links open in new tab with security attributes (08-03)
- Content cached in store after first load to avoid re-fetching (08-04)
- Status state machine pattern for async file loading (idle → loading → ready/error) (08-04)
- Milestone number derived from version (v1.0=10, v1.1=11) for unique IDs (09-01)
- Archived detection via 'shipped', 'complete', or '[Archive]' in line (09-01)
- filepath for archived milestones points to milestones/vX.Y-ROADMAP.md (09-01)
- Implicit single milestone created when no milestones section exists (09-01)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
